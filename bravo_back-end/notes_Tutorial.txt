It needs to use Maricel's connect.php that she emailed us.

It uses 4 files:
error_message.html
certificate_form.html
send_mail.php
thank_you.html

I have started modifying these files to use for our website.

FONT USE
I am working on the HTML Template for the Certificate.
Using Open Source Font from Google titled:
   font-family: 'Meie Script', cursive;
